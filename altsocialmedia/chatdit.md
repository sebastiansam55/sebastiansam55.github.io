# Chatdit

Chatdit<sup>1</sup> is a social media website created (?) by the dynamic duo of Diamond and Silk in 2018 as a response to their alleged "removal" from the facebook recommendation algorithm. 

Most pages have a Youtube video embed<sup>2</sup> from the dynamic duo explaining either the concept of the site or the latest news. There is one other public video on the channel from Feburary of 2020 that indicates that you are invited to the "beta" version of the website. The current video is the same clip but edited to remove the portion of the introduction about the "beta". This leads to questions about what is the nature of D&S's involvement with the site is. They duo still has the site listed in their twitter bio. 

Many of their 2021 twitter posts are completely identical, with a video of the pair meeting with Trump along with a bible quote that to my unexpert eye appears to be a original translation made by Joel Osteen in 2012. The quote unquote quote does not appear as it is literally transcribed in any version of the bible covered by the biblehub<sup>3</sup>  website.

But anyway this is supposed to be a article about their weird social media site not their weird twitter feed. 

The videos promintently embeded on nearly every page of the website are probably the best view that we have into the popularity of the website. The new and older intro video on the registration page have a combined 31k views. The D&S video at the top of every page has a mere 3.5k views. The youtube channel these videos are posted on has 1.86k subscribers.

So it would appear that their website has been a pretty big flop. I would not be surprised if I was the most prominent user on the days I was doing research.

## Users of the Site

The user with the largest follower count is predictably the diamond and silk account with nearly 13k followers. They aren't super active on the site they do post once or twice a week but I did not seem them responding to any comments left by their fans.

I would be surprised if this was them posting and not a developer maintaining their prescence reposting D&S content. They have a number of posts about downtime and I just don't see the pair being that involved to post updates like that if they didn't even record a new intro when the site came out of "beta". There doesn't appear to be any verification system on the site. I assume that this user is actually the duo based on user count alone.

## Groups on the Site

The default groups landing page appears to be sorted by the newest groups. Nothing inherently wrong with this but it doesn't do anything to help the sites image in my eyes when the groups I see the most are those with 1 or 2 people in them that appear to be groups for families.
Highlights include:

- Torah Girls Hangout (2 members)
- An assorment of "medjai" group pages (1-2 members) 
  - Appears to be related to some area in egypt?
- Dowers Family and Friends (English only)
  - Banner image is of an oil painting depicting recent Republican presidents in a social setting
- Byzantine Effort (1 member)

The Diamond and Silk group was the largest that I came across plugging in terms for the group search. With only ~1300 members the group function is even more sparse than other parts of the site.

## Site Technical Details

Nearly every page loads comes with some kind of error message that pops up in the bottom right corner. Many appear to be error codes directly from the SQL interface which is a big no-no and indicates to me the possibility of SQL injection attack. I won't comment on this further beyond saying don't do anything illegal.

In addition every page has a banner at the top of the page that tells you that you have to hard refresh the page to view the new updates.

At the bottom of each page there are two images supposedly linking to the Iphone and android app store respectively. Both of these images link you back to the main ChatDit.com page. As far as I can tell there is zero evidence of any app existing for chatdit as of now.

One truly revealing detail about the website is that the "#BetaTesting" tag has been trending every day that I have been on the website. However there seems to have been no change to the numbers of position of the tags since I have started tracking them.

One item on the main page "Hided my post" appears that the site keeps track of the people who hide your post. Why? I'm not sure what benefit it serves to track who doesn't like your content than to just sow the seeds of conflict and drama. Also horrendous grammar.

When looking at the people following users page the site offers the option to Unfollow them. Unsurpisingly selecting the option throws yet another error.

## Chatdit News

At the top of every page there is a link to "news" which leads to another website "chatditnews.com" which contains articles that appear to have been ripped and posted from a number of different sources. All of the articles are authored by "David Rufful" the founder of the Young Conservatives. If they truly are all written by Rufful he is truly prolific, having 1800+ posts attributed to him alone since the creation of chatditnews.com (probably in 2019 based on whois information).

It appears that the posts and post infrastructre are at least inspired by the work of Rufful;

Rufful's other site is another WordPress site with very similar layout, posts, and authors.

Other "authors" of "articles" on both the ChatDit site and the Analyzing America site include Natalia Kay (with 392 posts), and Carver Malone with only 2 posts. These accounts are all responsible for many more posts on the AnalyzingAmerica site.

## Ads

All of the ads that I noticed while I was on the site linked to other D&S websites, mainly their merch store.

## Developers of the Site

I'm not to familiar with the rhetoric put out by D&S but it appears clear that the website was not created in the US of A. The first few "pages" registered on the site include are created by one person using the default placeholder latin text "Lorem Ipsum". The creator of these pages lists Alkurn Technologies as his place of employment. His profile consists of almost all the information available to be entered in profile, most of it very much fitting the "testing" motif the pages this person has made as well.

# TL;DR:

Diamond and Silk's alternative social media website is a mess. Don't waste your time. It was truly a pain documenting this. Often nothing would load or take entire minutes to load.
