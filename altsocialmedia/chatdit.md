## Deep Dive: ChatDit
[ChatDit](https://chatdit.com) is a social media website created by the dynamic duo of Diamond and Silk in 2018 as a response to their removal from the Facebook recommendation algorithm for being deemed "unsafe to the community" <sup>[1](#links)</sup>.

The tag line of the site is a overly long and very passive aggressive reference to their personal experience of deplatforming from social media; 

<div class="center">
**"Build your Business, Keep your Business. Build your Platform as long as you are following the policies."**

**"You have freedom of speech, not freedom to hate."**

**"ChatDit is offering you more than just a Conversation. It’s a way to build a business."**
</div>

The promises of building your own business don't seem to have any meaning beyond maybe you should take a lesson from D&S and build an alternative social media site. There is no profit sharing for creators as far as I can tell. There isn't even a dynamic ad placement system, just the few ads from Mike Lindell and D&S themselves.

Most pages have multiple YouTube video embeds from the dynamic duo's channel explaining either the concept of the site or the "latest" news (The first video on the home page is dated 4-26-20<sup>[2](#links)</sup>). There is one other public video on the channel from February of 2020<sup>[3](#links)</sup> that indicates that you are invited to the "beta" version of the website. The current video is the same clip but edited to remove the portion of the introduction about the "beta".

These videos embedded on nearly every page of the website are probably the best view that we have into the popularity of the website. The new and older intro video on the registration page have a combined 31k views. The D&S ChatDit news video at the top of every page has a mere 3.5k views. The YouTube channel<sup>[4](#links)</sup> these videos are posted on has only 1.86k subscribers, compared to D&S main channel which has 323k subscribers.

So it would appear that despite the site being linked in their twitter bio, YouTube channel description along with being promoted nearly every time they stream their social media website has been a pretty big flop. I would not be surprised if I was the most prominent user on the days I was doing research.

## Users of the Site

The user with the largest follower count (as far as I can tell) is predictably the Diamond and Silk account<sup>[5](#links)</sup> with nearly 13k followers. They aren't super active on the site; they do post once or twice a week but I did not see them responding to any comments left by their fans.

I would be surprised if this was actually them posting and not a developer maintaining their presence reposting D&S content. They have a number of posts about downtime and I just don't see the pair being that involved to post updates like that if they didn't even record a new intro when the site came out of "beta". There doesn't appear to be any verification system on the site. I assume that this user is actually the duo based on user count alone.

## Groups on the Site

The default groups landing page appears to be sorted by the newest groups. Nothing inherently wrong with this but it doesn't do anything to help the sites image in my eyes when the groups I see the most are those with 1 or 2 people in them that appear to be groups for families.
Highlights include:

- "Torah Girls Hangout" (2 members)
- An assortment of "medjai" group pages (1-2 members) 
    - Appears to be related to some area in Egypt?
- "Dowers Family and Friends" (English only)
    - Banner image is of an oil painting depicting recent Republican presidents in a social setting
- "Byzantine Effort" (1 member)


The Diamond and Silk group was the largest that I came across plugging in terms for the group search. With only ~1300 members the group function is even more sparse than other parts of the site.

## CHATD IT, LLC Terms of Service
The ChatDit Terms of Service lays out a number of interesting points about the website.

The first thing I want to note is that there appears to be a typo in the header. It lists the title as 
![chatdittos](https://github.com/sebastiansam55/sebastiansam55.github.io/raw/master/altsocialmedia/assets/chatdittos.png)

In the above clip we also see mention of the mobile application which as far as I can tell has never existed.

The website does not follow the [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/) and tells anyone who resides in the European Union that they are not allowed to use the Website/Platform.
![chatditnogdpr](https://github.com/sebastiansam55/sebastiansam55.github.io/raw/master/altsocialmedia/assets/chatditnogdpr.png)

Despite the reported purpose of the site to be "Build your Platform" the Terms of Service explicitly disallow the promotion of "third-party products, services, or brands "outside" of our ChatDit Platform"

![chatdittosnoexternal](https://github.com/sebastiansam55/sebastiansam55.github.io/raw/master/altsocialmedia/assets/chatdittosnoexternal.png)

Most of the TOS seems to be drawn from some boiler plate TOSs that you can find on other random websites across the web.

As the reader may or may not know D&S are primarily based in Fayetteville, NC. This includes their ChatDit LLC which was incorporated on 2/1/2019. Interestingly they registered a different LLC "Chit Chat Me" in late 2018. Not sure why they switched names and I don't really see anything else out there about "Chit Chat Me" other than it being the name of their Live Show. It is unclear to me what the purpose of the Chit Chat Me LLC was.

It doesn't seem like there is a way to permalink to a NC business registration but the search system I used can be found [here](https://www.sosnc.gov/online_services/search/by_title/_Business_Registration)

## ChatDit News

At the top of every page there is a link to "news" which leads to another website ["chatditnews.com"](https://chatditnews.com) which contains articles that appear to have been ripped and posted from a number of different sources. All of the articles are authored by "David Rufful" the founder of the Young Conservatives. If they truly are all written by Rufful he is truly prolific, having 1800+ posts attributed to him alone since the creation of [chatditnews.com](https://chatditnews.com) (probably in 2019 based on WHOIS information).

It appears that the posts and post infrastructure are at least inspired by the work of Rufful; [Analyzing America](https://www.analyzingamerica.org/) is
Rufful's main site, another WordPress site with very similar layout, posts, and authors.

    </tr>

Other "authors" of "articles" on both the ChatDit site and the Analyzing America site include Natalia Kay (with 392 posts), and Carver Malone with only 2 posts. These accounts are all responsible for many more posts on the AnalyzingAmerica site.

## Ads

Many of the ads that I noticed while I was on the site linked to other D&S websites, mainly their merchandise store. The ad block program I use effectively blocks these ads.

The notable exception to the all Diamond and Silk advertising on the site is a link to the mypillow.com website where you can purchase Mike Lindell's book *What Are the Odds?*.

## Developers of the Site

The first few "pages" created on the site appear to have been created by one  or two people using the default placeholder Latin text "Lorem Ipsum". One of the page creators lists Alkurn Technologies as his place of employment, a India based website development firm. His profile consists of almost all the information available to be entered in profile, most of it very much fitting the "testing" motif the pages this person has made as well. This obviously isn't conclusive and I have briefly examined some the page source code looking for any information but did not see any clues.

## Site Technical Details

The rest of this article gets pretty into the weeds about the actual technical details of the site, including developers and technologies used (or misused). You've been warned!

There are a few issues to note upon first login to the site. When you login the site POSTs your username and password in plain text but thankfully the site will only accept it over HTTPS. What this means in practice is that ChatDit servers have access to your password and email. There is no way to tell what they do on the back end with that information, ideally they would be hashing your password and storing that, but they could also be storing the passwords in plain text unencrypted as many many other sites do.
![postlogin](https://github.com/sebastiansam55/sebastiansam55.github.io/raw/master/altsocialmedia/assets/postlogin.png)

Nearly every page loads comes with some kind of error message that pops up in the bottom right corner. Many appear to be error codes directly from the SQL interface which is a big no-no and indicates to me the possibility of SQL injection attack. I won't comment on this further beyond saying don't do anything illegal.
![sqlerror](https://github.com/sebastiansam55/sebastiansam55.github.io/raw/master/altsocialmedia/assets/sqlerror.png)

In addition every page has a banner at the top of the page that tells you that you have to "hard" refresh (to clear the cache presumably?) the page to view the new updates.
![newupdates](https://github.com/sebastiansam55/sebastiansam55.github.io/raw/master/altsocialmedia/assets/newupdates.png)

At the bottom of each page there are two images supposedly linking to the iPhone and android app store respectively. Both of these images link you back to the main ChatDit.com page. As far as I can tell there is zero evidence of any app existing for ChatDit as of now. I did find one archived Github [ChatDit App Repo](https://github.com/vivekkadu/ChatDit) with one commit in it titled "ChatDit"<sup>[](#links)</sup> that had the starting files for both iPhone and Android apps, but no evidence other than the name that they are related.

One truly revealing detail about the website is that the "#BetaTesting" tag has been trending every day that I have been on the website. However there seems to have been no change to the numbers of position of the tags since I have started tracking them.

One item on the main page "Hided my post" appears that the site keeps track of the people who hide your post. Why? I'm not sure what benefit it serves to track who doesn't like your content than to just sow the seeds of conflict and drama. Also horrendous grammar.

When looking at the people following users page the site offers the option to Unfollow them. Unsurprisingly selecting the option throws yet another error.

The site itself appears to be built on the ["Yii2"](https://www.yiiframework.com/) PHP framework, based upon some of the text displayed on the [ChatDit 404](https://www.chatdit.com/404) error page.

# TL;DR:

Diamond and Silk's alternative social media website is a mess. Don't waste your time like I have. It was truly a pain documenting this. Often nothing would load or take entire minutes to load. 

There are so many rabbit holes to fall down here, the AnalyzingAmerica relationship, they have a "tax-exempt" non-profit called [S.I.S.T.A.S.](https://sistasnp.com/) that I haven't been able to find in IRS public info (probably because of the name). The SISTAS page is also sponsored by Mike Lindell.
